   We took the most popular food brands among Americans, in nine
   categories young kids love, and used the current US dietary guidelines
   to illustrate what the daily recommended amount of sugar for kids looks
   like. Our math: Each of these images represents 33 grams of sugar. The
   recommendation is that added sugar should equal less than 10% of
   one&#39;s daily caloric needs. The median calories for moderately
   active 4- to 8-year-olds is 1,500 calories. So we calculated 9% of
   1,500 as 135 calories, which equals 33 grams of sugar per day. If your
   child consumes what is pictured, they will probably have maxed out
   their recommended sugar intake for the whole day.

Story highlights

     * Nearly two-thirds of kids consumed at least one sugary drink on any
       given day, data show
     * "Sugar-sweetened beverages are still the top source of added
       sugars," one expert says

   (CNN)A new study sheds light on just how many calories and added sugars
   children are drinking.
   Almost two-thirds of children in the United States consumed at least
   one sugary beverage on any given day -- and roughly 30% consumed two or
   more a day -- between 2011 and 2014, according to the study, released
   Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
   [102]National Center for Health Statistics.

   On average, drinking two or more sugar-sweetened beverages a day
   provided more than 10% of the total daily calories among the children,
   said Asher Rosinger, epidemic intelligence service officer at the CDC
   and lead author of the study.

   [103]Current US dietary guidelines recommend consuming less than 10% of
   your daily calories from added sugars and limiting or removing
   sugar-sweetened beverages from your diet.

   "This study is important, because consuming sugar-sweetened beverages
   is associated with [105]weight gain, [106]Type 2 diabetes, [107]dental
   caries (cavities) and [108]dyslipidemia (high cholesterol) in children,
   all of which have serious negative downstream health consequences,"
   Rosinger said.

   He said that the study provides the most recent estimates of the
   calories children are consuming from sugar-sweetened beverages.
   In response, Rachel Hicks, a spokeswoman for the American Beverage
   Association, issued a statement that said, "America's beverage
   companies agree that children and adults should be mindful of the
   calories they consume from sugar."

   For the new study, researchers analyzed data on the consumption of
   sugar-sweetened beverages among children and adults in the United
   States from 2011 to 2014. The data came from the [111]National Health
   and Nutrition Examination Survey.
   The researchers assessed the number of times children and adults drank
   sugar-sweetened beverages -- such as regular soda, certain fruit
   drinks, sports and energy drinks, and sweetened coffees and teas -- and
   then summed the number of calories.
   The researchers found that among children, 2 to 19 years old, 64.5% of
   boys and 61.3% of girls consumed at least one sugar-sweetened beverage
   on a given day.

   "This does not mean that all of those children exceeded 10% of their
   total calories from sugar-sweetened beverages," Rosinger said.
   Overall, children consumed an average of 143 calories and 7.3% of their
   daily energy intake from sugary beverages, the data showed.
   The [113]American Heart Association recommended in a study last year
   that children should consume no more than about 6 teaspoons, or 100
   calories, of added sugar a day. The study, [114]published in the
   journal Circulation, recommended that children should limit their
   intake of sugary drinks to 8 ounces weekly.
   [115]No more than 6 teaspoons of sugar a day for kids
   No more than 6 teaspoons of sugar a day for kids
   [116]Sugar recommendation: No more than 6 teaspoons per day for kids
   Six teaspoons a day would be less than 10% of daily calories for most
   children, said Dr. Miriam Vos, an associate professor of pediatrics at
   Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, who was lead
   author of those recommendations.
   "Sugar-sweetened beverages are still the top source of added sugars for
   children in the US and cause unhealthy weight gain," Vos said.
   "We still have a long way to go in ensuring health for children by
   reducing consumption of added sugars," she said.
   The new study showed differences among age and ethnic groups.

   Older children, ages 12 to 19, consumed more sugar-sweetened beverages
   on average than younger children, according to the data.
   The researchers also found that non-Hispanic Asian children consumed
   the least amount of calories from sugar-sweetened beverages on a given
   day, compared with other groups.
   The findings provide "the first nationally representative estimates of
   sugar-sweetened beverage consumption for non-Hispanic Asian children,"
   Rosinger said.

   As for people 20 and older, the researchers found that about half --
   53.6% of men and 45.1% of women -- consumed at least one
   sugar-sweetened beverage on a given day from 2011 to 2014.
   The data showed that, overall, adults consumed an average of 145
   calories and 6.5% of their daily energy intake from sugary drinks.
   Young adults had the highest mean intake, and non-Hispanic Asian men
   and women consumed the fewest calories from sugary drinks.

   The American Beverage Association indicated in its statement that it
   has launched various initiatives in an effort to encourage healthy
   calorie intakes among Americans.
   "We are committed to being part of real solutions to public health
   challenges with initiatives like [122]Balance Calories, which aims to
   reduce sugar and calories consumed from beverages across America. We
   also have voluntarily placed clear calorie labels on the front of every
   bottle, can and pack we produce. Through our [123]School Beverage
   Guidelines, we voluntarily removed full-calorie sodas from schools,
   replacing them with a range of lower-calorie and smaller-portion
   choices," the statement said.
   In 2009-2010, six in 10 children and five in 10 adults in the US drank
   a sugar-sweetened beverage on a given day. On average, youth consumed
   155 calories and adults took in 151 calories, [124]according to the
   CDC.
